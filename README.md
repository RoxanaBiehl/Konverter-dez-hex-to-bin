Coverter
At some point at school i needed a converter that only converts Decimal to Hexadecimal to Binary at once. So I made this converter to help me.

The converter is only converting decimal or hexadecimal to binary. 
The functions are quite simple. You type the number you want to convert in the field, and then You click on the button Konvert for convert. 
When you have your result you can start a new convertion by clicking clear, or if you want to exit the program you click the close button.
